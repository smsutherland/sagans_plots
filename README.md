This is just a collection of plotting utilities I use as part of my researach.

You may find something useful in here, but first and foremost, this is made for my uses.
Feel free to fork and change things as you see fit!
If there's something you add, please submit a PR so that everyone can benefit from your plot.

See the examples directory for how to use some of these plotting utilities.
